1. Problem: Have a low word count
Report file: low_word_count.csv
Description: Without enough text on a page, Google will have trouble understanding what the content is about. 

If Google doesn't know what the content is about, it won't be able to rank your content for the search terms you are targeting. 

By adding more text, you are telling Google's crawlers, and your end users, more about what it is you have to offer. Anything less than a few hundred words is considered thin content and will be nearly impossible to rank.
Solution: Add more content to your page so that it isn't considered thin content and has a better chance of ranking. In general the average web page that ranks on page 1 of Google contains 2200 words.
